# Descriptive and Predictive Code

## Overview

RideAnalyzer is a versatile codebase that serves two primary purposes: Descriptive and Predictive analysis for public transportation systems. This repository is organized into two main components, each tailored to specific analytical objectives.

### Descriptive Code
The Descriptive Code section is designed to provide an insightful analysis of the current situation within a public transportation network. It leverages historical data and various metrics to offer a comprehensive view of the system's performance. Understanding the current state of the transportation system is essential for making informed decisions and optimizing its operation.

### Predictive Code
The Predictive Code section takes analysis to the next level by utilizing predictive models. It forecasts ridership patterns at different stations based on a variety of variables and historical trends. Our choice is the decision tree regressor.
